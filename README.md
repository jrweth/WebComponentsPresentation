WebComponentsPresentation
=========================

Presentation in Deck.js briefly highlighting Web Components

Acknowledgements
----------------

Based upon presentation by Eric Bidelman at O'Reilly Fluent Conference 2014 and also [html5rocks.com](http://html5rocks.com

Installation
------------

Uses bower to grab necessary libraries.
* grab the code
* install bower
* cd into directory and run "bower install"
* open up index.html in a browser (use Chrome - trust me)

Also, due to security issues,  the import functionality (and therefore slides) wont actually work unless you actually serve up the presentation from a webserver (e.g. localhost)
